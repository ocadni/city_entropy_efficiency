\section{Introduction}\label{S0}

\begin{itemize}

\item interactions $(g,\lambda)$ increase the travel time, reduce the efficiency, and increase the entropy production.


\item $\lambda=0$: 

- we observe a change in behaviour of the entropy production $\Delta S_D$ vs the disorder parameter $\alpha$ as the interaction strength $g$ increases.  For sufficiently large $g$, a bit of disorder can reduce the entropy production. 


\item $\lambda=0.5$: 

- we observe a change in the complexity of the time series in days as the interaction strength $g$ increases.

- the efficiency and velocity display a (nontrivial) maximum for some disorder $\alpha^*(g)$ depending on the parameter $g$.  

- mutual information between $(t_O,t_D)$ increases whereas that of $(\Delta x_{OD},\Delta t_{OD})$ decreases by introducing $\lambda$. 



\end{itemize}


\section{Models and Settings}\label{S1}
In this section, we present the main definitions and methods which are used to model the network flow dynamics.   
Consider a city of $N$ sites with local populations $\{m_a:a=1,\dots,N\}$ and total population $M=\sum_a m_a$. The connectivity graph of the city is given by $G(V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of sites and $E$ is the set of directed edges $(ab)$. Here we take a two dimensional square lattice of size $N=L\times L$, where all edges have the same length and the same free travel times. We use the simple growth model introduced in Ref. \cite{Li-nc-2017} to produce reasonable population distributions for the model cities. The population density is fixed to $M/N=10^3$ in the following.

Given the population distribution $m_a$, we use the following mobility law to construct the flux of movements $m_{a\to b}$ from origins $a$ to destinations $b$, 
\begin{align}\label{mab}
m_{a\to b}=m_ap_{a\to b}=m_a\frac{m_b/M(r_{ab})}{\sum_{c\neq a} m_c/M(r_{ac})},
\end{align}
where $M(r_{ab})$ is the population in the circle of radius $r_{ab}$ centred at site $b$. The ratio $m_b/M(r_{ab})$ can be interpreted as the attractiveness of site $b$ for an individual at site $a$. 

Finally, the flows of movements on edges $(ab)\in E$ are determined by a flux distribution problem that satisfies the system constraints and preferences, as follows. 
 

\subsection{The movement process}\label{S11}
Here is the process of moving from the origins to destinations in a single day:

\begin{itemize}

\item The starting times of the OD trips are distributed uniformly in the origin time interval $\Delta T_O$. We assume that $\Delta T_O$ is the same for all origins. In each time step, the time increases by $\Delta t=1$. Driver $i$ starts its trip and becomes active at time $t_O(i) \in \Delta T_O$. The trip will become inactive when the driver reaches its destination at time $t_D(i) \in \Delta T_D$. The destination time interval $\Delta T_D$ is determined by the system structure and dynamics (see Fig. \ref{Tday}). 
The arrival times of the drivers to destination site $a$ determine the destination time interval $\Delta T_D(a)$ of that site. 
The travel time from origin to destination for driver $i$ is denoted by $\Delta t_{OD}(i)=t_D(i)-t_O(i)$. 

\item An active driver $i$ at site $a$ chooses the next site as follows: with probability $\alpha$ the next site is chosen randomly and uniformly from the set of neighbouring sites. With probability $1-\alpha$ the neighbour that minimizes the expected travel time to the destination $D(i)$ is selected. The expected travel time on edge $(ab)$ is denoted by $\tilde{t}_{ab}$. The expected travel times in day $d$ are estimated by using the actual travel times $t_{ab}$ from the previous day:
\begin{align}\label{tab0}
\tilde{t}_{ab}(d)=\lambda t_{ab}(d-1)+(1-\lambda) \tilde{t}_{ab}(d-1).
\end{align}
For the initial day $\tilde{t}_{ab}(0)=t_{ab}(0)$, where the $t_{ab}(0)$ are the travel times for free lines. 

\item Let flow $F_{ab}(t)$ be the number of people that enter edge $(ab)$ at time step $t$. Given the input flows, then the actual travel times are obtained from 
\begin{align}\label{tab}
t_{ab}(F_{ab})=t_{ab}(0)\left(1+g(\frac{F_{ab}}{F_{ab}^*})^{\mu}\right),
\end{align}
with $g (F_{ab}/F_{ab}^*)^{\mu}$ to model the influence of flows on the travel times \cite{BPR-1964,lc-trans-1976,lc-trans-2011}. Here $F_{ab}^*$ is a measure of the line capacity. For simplicity, we assume that $t_{ba}(0)=t_{ab}(0)$ and $F_{ba}^*= F_{ab}^*$.
In the following we take $\mu=3$, $t_{ab}(0)=1$, and $F_{ab}^*=M/|E|$ in all simulations.

\end{itemize}

The actual travel time $t_{ab}$ determines the time that a person spends on edge $(ab)$. The total number of persons on edge $(ab)$ at time step $t$ is denoted by the flow density $\rho_{ab}(t)$. 


\section{Results}\label{S2}
Let us start with the effects of interactions on the cumulative distribution of the travel times $P(\Delta t_{OD}>T)$ in the absence of any randomness in the movements ($\alpha=0$). As Fig. \ref{Ti} shows, the travel times increase by introducing the interactions either by considering the effects of flows on the trips (with $g$) or by knowing the travel information from the previous days (with $\lambda$). The latter says that a selfish way of using the information without any coordination could result to a chaotic situation \cite{Apps-ieee-2019}. We know that interacting systems can display complex behaviours and interactions may reduce the system predictability \cite{watts-sci-2006}. In the following, we see how the interplay of the above interactions with disorder in the movements affects a measure of complexity and predictability of the movement process. In addition, we follow the changes in the efficiency and a measure of entropy production in the system to see how the relation between these qualities depend on the macroscopic state (phase) of the system \cite{efc-srep-2020}.  
                    

\subsection{Complexity and predictability}\label{S21}
A measure of predictability for two stochastic variables $x,x'$ is provided by the mutual information of the two variables,
\begin{align}
\mathrm{MI}(x,x')=\sum_{x,x'}P(x,x')\log\frac{P(x,x')}{P(x)P(x')},
\end{align}
where $P(x,x'), P(x)$ and $P(x')$ are the joint and marginalized probability distributions of the variables.

Let us define the mutual information between the destination and origin times
\begin{align}
\Pi_{t,t}=\mathrm{MI}(t_O,t_D),
\end{align}
and the mutual information between the travel time and the geometrical distance, 
\begin{align}
\Pi_{x,t}=\mathrm{MI}(\Delta x_{OD},\Delta t_{OD}).
\end{align}
Figure \ref{Pi} shows the results of numerical simulations for these quantities in a square lattice of linear size $L=20$.
As expected, the above measures of predictability diminish with increasing $g$ or $\alpha$, except the small jump that is observed 
for $\lambda=0.5$ when $\alpha$ changes from zero.  On the other hand, we observe that $\Pi_{t,t}$ increases but $\Pi_{x,t}$ decreases after using the travel times from the previous days (i.e., for $\lambda=0.5$). Note that when $\lambda=0$ all edges have the same estimated travel times $\tilde{t}_{ab}(d)=t_{ab}(0)=1$ where the shortest path is strongly correlated with the geometrical distance $\Delta x_{OD}$. On the other side, when $\lambda=0.5$ there are some edges with small travel times in the previous day and all drivers are aware of this information which in turn determines the shortest path to their destinations. Therefore, one expects to observe less correlations here between the geometrical distance and the actual travel times. However, the same global information now makes the arrival times to the destinations more dependent on the departure times from the origins and results to larger mutual information between the two time variables. 


To address the complexity of the process, we check the presence of long range correlations in the time evolution of the system. 
Consider a stationary time series $\{\cdots,x_{n-1},x_n,x_{n+1},\cdots\}$ and a string of data points which is divided into two equal data sets $\mathbf{x}_{past}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{future}$ of length $l$. A measure of complexity can be defined by the scaling of the mutual information $\mathrm{MI}(\mathbf{x}_{past},\mathbf{x}_{future})$ with $l$. This information could be independent of the size or increase logarithmically or even sub-linearly with $l$ \cite{bialek-nc-2001}. In the following, however, we study a computationally more efficient but approximate way of detecting a time series complexity, which is based on an estimation of information rate (sample entropy) in different time scales \cite{samp-ajp-2000,costa-prl-2002}. 

Consider the coarse grained time series $\{\cdots,y_{n-1},y_n,y_{n+1},\cdots\}$ obtained by averaging the original time series within a window of size $w$, i.e., $y_n=(\sum_{n'=(n-1)w+1}^{nw}x_{n'})/w$. Let $\mathbf{y}_n(l)$ be a sequence of length $l$ starting at $n$. We define $p(l:r,w)$ as the probability that two such sequences are within distance $r$ of each other, i.e., $d(\mathbf{y}_n(l),\mathbf{y}_{n'}(l))<r \times std(x)$. Here $d(\mathbf{y}_{n_1}(l),\mathbf{y}_{n_2}(l))=\max_{0\le n'<l}|y_{n_1+n'}-y_{n_2+n'}|$ and $std(x)$ denotes the standard deviation of the original time series. Then the sample entropy at scale factor $w$ is given by $SampEn(l,r,w)=-\log (p(l+1:r,w)/p(l:r,w))$. The ratio of the two probabilities is indeed the conditional probability that two sequences of size $l$ which are within distance $r$ of each other are still close when the size increases to $l+1$. Here we take $l=2$ and $r=0.2$. A large value of the above sample entropy for large scale factors indicates on the presence of long range correlations in the system. It also means that still distinct sequence patterns appear when the series is looked at larger time scales.
 
         
Now let us define the average flow density, using the local flow densities $\rho_{ab}(t)$,
\begin{align}
\rho(t)=\frac{1}{|E|}\sum_{(ab)}\rho_{ab}(t).
\end{align}
To study the day to day correlations we take the maximum flow density $\rho^*=\max_{t}{\rho(t)}$ and the associated time series $\{\cdots,\rho^*_{d-1},\rho^*_d,\rho^*_{d+1},\cdots\}$ in a sequence of days indexed by $d$. Figure \ref{Sw} displays the sample entropy in terms of the scale factor $w$ for single instances of the above time series. We observe that the sample entropy decays very slowly around $g=2$ signalling the presence of long range correlations in the system. In the following we see how this change in the complexity affects the qualitative behaviour of other interesting quantities in the system.              


\subsection{Efficiency and entropy production}\label{S22}
The average travel time in the process is given by
\begin{align}
\tau_{OD}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i} \Delta t_{OD}(i).
\end{align}
The average number of travels per person in a day is obtained from the sum of all the input flows $F_{ab}(t)$ for different edges and times, 
\begin{align}
\sigma_{OD}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{t} \sum_{(ab)} F_{ab}(t).
\end{align}
A measure of efficiency is defined by ratio of the two
\begin{align}
\eta_{OD}=\frac{1/\tau_{OD}}{\sigma_{OD}}.
\end{align}
 
For each person we can also define the velocity $v_{OD}(i)=\Delta x_{OD}(i)/\Delta t_{OD}(i)$, given the geometrical origin to destination distances $\Delta x_{OD}(i)$. Then the average velocity is
\begin{align}
v_{OD}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i} v_{OD}(i).
\end{align}


A measure of increase in the system disorder or uncertainty (entropy production) is provided by the distribution of the destination time intervals  
\begin{align}
\Delta S_D=\langle \log \Delta T_D \rangle-\langle \log \Delta T_O \rangle=\frac{1}{N}\sum_a \log \Delta T_D(a)-\log \Delta T_O.
\end{align}
As mentioned above, $\Delta T_O$ is the same for all the sites $a$.





\section{Conclusion}\label{S3}

\begin{itemize}

\item randomness in the movements can reduce the uncertainty in the distribution of destination time intervals.

\item variation of the entropy production with randomness in the movements can be used to identify the ordered and disordered phases of the flows.

\item a selfish usage of information from the previous days results to smaller efficiency and velocity but at the same time can increase the mutual information between the origin and destination times of the trips.  Here some randomness in the movements can also increase the efficiency and velocity of the movements.
 

\end{itemize}
